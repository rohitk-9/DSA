'''Given an integer N. The task is to return the position of first set bit found from the right side in the binary representation of the number.
Note: If there is no set bit in the integer N, then return 0 from the function.  

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 18
Output: 
2
Explanation: 
Binary representation of 18 is 010010,the first set bit from the right side is at position 2.

Example 2:

Input: 
N = 12 
Output: 
3 
Explanation: 
Binary representation of  12 is 1100, the first set bit from the right side is at position 3.'''
